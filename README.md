Problem 1: Simple Arithmetic Calculator
Write a NASM program that:
Prompts the user to enter two integer numbers using scanf.
Prompts the user to select an operation:
1 for Addition
2 for Subtraction
3 for Multiplication
4 for Division
Performs the selected operation.
Displays the result using printf.
Requirements:
Use extern printf and extern scanf.
Properly declare format strings for input/output.
Handle division carefully (avoid division by zero).

Problem 2: Sum of Numbers (Loop)
Write a NASM program that:
Prompts the user to enter a positive integer N using scanf.
Uses a loop to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to N.
Prints the result using printf.
Example Output:
Enter N: 5
Sum = 15


Problem 3: Find the Maximum in an Array
Write a NASM program that:
Defines a hardcoded array of 10 signed integers.
Iterates through the array using a loop.
Finds and prints the maximum number using printf.
Requirements:
Use indexed addressing to access array elements.
Use comparison and conditional jump instructions (cmp, jg, etc.).

Submission:
Push each .asm source file to a GitHub repository (you can create a separate folder for each problem or keep them all in one repo).
Add a README.md file briefly describing each problem.
Send the GitHub repository link to the TAs.

Problem 4: Write a program in the NASM Programming Language that calculates the power of a to b, where a and b are entered by the user.
